INGREDIENTS:


FOR THE SAUCE

Olive Oil

Garlic: Gigi adds one clove of garlic to the sauce. You can mince it yourself, or use the kind from a jar.

Shallot: You’ll need to mince one shallot.

Red Pepper Flakes: While Gigi likes her sauce spicy, this ingredient is totally optional.

Tomato Paste: No canned sauce in this recipe! Gigi uses tomato paste, then adds other components to thin it into a sauce. It’s very easy to find and any brand will do.

Heavy Cream: It will make your sauce nice and thick, but still creamy. You can swap it out for milk if you prefer.

Butter: It helps to cut down the acidity of the tomatoes, for a beautifully silky, creamy sauce. For a vegan sauce, use margarine, or vegan butter instead.

Parmesan Cheese: Grating fresh parmesan will always give the strongest flavor, but pre-grated cheese works well too.

Basil: Chopped fresh basil makes the perfect garnish for your final plate of pasta, adding a bit of green to the plate.

Salt & Pepper: for seasoning.





FOR THE PASTA

Shells Pasta: Gigi used Orecchiette, a type of shell pasta in her original recipe. They’re a great option because they’ll cup the sauce nicely.
